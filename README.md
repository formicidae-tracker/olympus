The [FORmicidae Tracker (FORT)](https://formicidae-tracker.github.io) is an advanced online tracking system designed specifically 
for studying social insects, particularly ants and bees, FORT utilizes fiducial markers for 
extended individual tracking. Its key features include real-time online tracking and a modular 
design architecture that supports distributed processing. The project's current repositories 
encompass comprehensive hardware blueprints, technical documentation, and associated firmware 
and software for online tracking and offline data analysis.

This repository contains the backend and frontend code of progressive webapp that monitors tracking experiments and notifies user of potential upcoming failure.
